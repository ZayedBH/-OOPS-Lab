Project Overview

The Student Mark Analysis System is designed to efficiently manage and analyze student marks, enabling users to add, update, search, sort, and delete student records. The system provides a structured approach to tracking academic performance, ensuring accurate data management and insightful analysis. A menu-based user interface enhances user interaction and experience.
Key Features of the System

    Student Registration:
    Add new student records with attributes such as Name, Student ID, Course, Marks, and Enrollment Date.

    Mark Update:
    Allow users to update marks for students, including adjustments for re-evaluations or extra credits.

    Sorting:
    The system can sort student records based on various attributes, such as Name, Student ID, or Marks.

    Search:
    Users can search the student database using attributes such as Name, Student ID, or Course.

    Data Saving & Loading:
    Student marks data can be saved to a text file and retrieved upon restarting the system.

Data Structures Used

    Linked Lists:
    Used to store student records, where each node contains the details of a student.

    Pointer Array:
    Each node's pointer is stored in an array, facilitating efficient searching and sorting operations.

Algorithms Used

    Linear Search:
    Utilized for searching through unsorted student records.

    Binary Search:
    Employed for searching within sorted student records.

    Merge Sort:
    Used for sorting student records based on selected attributes.

    Bubble Sort:
    Implemented for maintaining sorted order during insertion operations.

System Design
Menu

The user interface consists of a menu that offers various options, managed through switch cases. The menu continues to loop until the user opts to exit the program.

    Student Registration
        Create a new node for the student.
        Add necessary data to the node.
        Link the new node to the previous node.
        If auto-sorting is enabled, use bubble sort to maintain order.

    Mark Update
        Search for the student record to be updated.
        Update the marks as required.
        If the sorted attribute changes, re-sort the array.

    Student Deletion
        Search for the student to be deleted.
        Remove the student record from the list.
        Update the pointer array accordingly.

    Sorting
        Select an attribute for sorting.
        Use merge sort to efficiently organize the records.

    Searching
        Choose the attribute to search by.
        Check if the array is sorted based on the selected attribute.
            If sorted, perform a binary search.
            If unsorted, use linear search.

    Data Saving
        Open the save file using file handling.
        Write each student’s data to the file sequentially.

Conclusion

The Student Mark Analysis System aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing and analyzing student academic performance. By utilizing appropriate data structures and algorithms, the system ensures quick data retrieval and processing, contributing to better academic management and insights for educators and students alike.

### Explanation of the Program

1. **Data Structure**: The program uses a linked list to manage student records. Each student is represented as a node in the list.

2. **Functionality**:
   - **Register Student**: Adds a new student record.
   - **Update Marks**: Updates marks for a specific student.
   - **Delete Student**: Removes a student record based on student ID.
   - **Search Student**: Searches for a student by ID and displays their information.
   - **Sort Students**: Sorts students by marks using merge sort.
   - **Save Data**: Saves the student records to a text file.
   - **Load Data**: Loads student records from a text file upon starting the program.
   - **Display Students**: Displays all registered students.

3. **Menu-driven Interface**: The program uses a loop to display a menu and execute the user's choice until they decide to exit.

4. **Memory Management**: The program frees allocated memory when exiting.

### Running the Program

To run the program:
- Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
- Execute the resulting binary.
- Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations.

Feel free to modify or expand the functionality as needed!
